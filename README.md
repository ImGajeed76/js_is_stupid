# js is stupid

JS is stupid, is a little fun program that turns JS-code in to unreadable JS code by only using `()[]{}=>+!/\`. 

It was inspired by some YouTuber, but I didn't remember who it was. So shout out to him who made the code!

## Usage

- Paste your JS-code into the `input.js` file.
- Run the `index.js` file.
- Copy your code from the `output.js` file.
